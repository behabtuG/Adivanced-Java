Array is a data structure that is used to store variables that are of similar data types at contiguous locations.
The main advantage of the array is random access and cache friendliness. There are mainly three types of the array:

    . One Dimensional (1D) Array
    . Two Dimension (2D) Array
    . Multidimensional Array
 One Dimensional Array:

     . It is a list of the variable of similar data types.
     . It allows random access and all the elements can be accessed with the help of their index.
     . The size of the array is fixed.
     . For a dynamically sized array, vector can be used in C++.
     . Representation of 1D array:

 Two Dimensional Array:

     . It is a list of lists of the variable of the same data type.
     . It also allows random access and all the elements can be accessed with the help of their index.
     . It can also be seen as a collection of 1D arrays. It is also known as the Matrix.
     . Its dimension can be increased from 2 to 3 and 4 so on.
     . They all are referred to as a multi-dimension array.
     . The most common multidimensional array is a 2D array.
     . Representation of 2 D array:

 Applications of Arrays:

     . 2D Arrays are used to implement matrices.
     . Arrays can be used to implement various data structures like a heap, stack, queue, etc.
     . They allow random access.
     . They are cache-friendly.
