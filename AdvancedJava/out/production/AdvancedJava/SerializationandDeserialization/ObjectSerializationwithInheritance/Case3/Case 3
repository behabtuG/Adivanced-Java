Case 3: If the superclass is serializable, but we donâ€™t want the subclass to be serialized

There is no direct way to prevent sub-class from serialization in java. One possible way by which a programmer can achieve this is by
implementing the writeObject() and readObject() methods in the subclass and needs to throw NotSerializableException from these methods.
 These methods are executed during serialization and de-serialization, respectively. By overriding these methods,
 we are just implementing our custom serialization.
