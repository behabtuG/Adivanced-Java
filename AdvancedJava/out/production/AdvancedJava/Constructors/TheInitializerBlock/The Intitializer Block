In order to perform any operations while assigning values to an instance data member, an initializer block is used. In simpler terms, the
initializer block is used to declare/initialize the common part of various constructors of a class. It runs every time whenever the object
is created.

The initializer block contains the code that is always executed whenever an instance is created and it runs each time when an object of the class
 is created. There are 3 areas where we can use the initializer blocks:

    . Constructors
    . Methods
    . Blocks

        Tip: If we want to execute some code once for all objects of a class then we will be using Static Block in Java

 Note: The contents of the initializer block are executed whenever any constructor is invoked (before the constructor’s contents)
 The order of initialization constructors and initializer block doesn’t matter, the initializer block is always executed before the constructor.
