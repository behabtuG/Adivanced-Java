Important Points:
The main method in Java is no extra-terrestrial method. Apart from the fact that main() is just like any other method & can be overloaded in a
similar manner, JVM always looks for the method signature to launch the program.

    . The normal main method acts as an entry point for the JVM to start the execution of program.
    . We can overload the main method in Java. But the program doesnâ€™t execute the overloaded main method when we run your program, we need to call
     the overloaded main method from the actual main method only.
