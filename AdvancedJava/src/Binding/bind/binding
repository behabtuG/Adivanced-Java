Binding refers to the process of converting identifiers (such as variable and performance names) into addresses. Binding is done for
each variable and functions. For functions, it means that matching the call with the right function definition by the compiler.
It takes place either at compile time or at runtime.

In programming and software design, binding is an application programming interface (API) that provides glue code specifically made
to allow a programming language to use a foreign library or operating system service (one that is not native to that language).

Implementing dynamic binding in java by extending the class and overriding it. Explanation : The parent class bird has a method to
eat, which prints the bird is eating. The subclass of bird, peacock, extends the parent class bird and overrides the method eat by
printing"peacock is eating".
