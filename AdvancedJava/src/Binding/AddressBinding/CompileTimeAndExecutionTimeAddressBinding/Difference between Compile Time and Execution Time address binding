Address Binding is the association of program instructions and data to the actual physical memory location. There are various types
 of address binding in the operating system.

There are 3 types of Address Binding:

    1. Compile Time Address Binding
    2. Load Time Address Binding
    3. Execution Time Address Binding

 Here, we compare Compile Time and Execution Time address binding as following below.

 Compile Time Address Binding:
   If the compiler is responsible of performing address binding then it is called as compile time address binding. This type of
   address binding will be done before loading the program into memory. The compiler required to interact with the operating system
   memory manager to perform compile time address binding.

 Load Time Address Binding:
   This type of address binding will be done after loading the program into memory. Load time address binding will be done by
   operating memory manager.

   Difference between Compile Time and Load Time address Binding:
