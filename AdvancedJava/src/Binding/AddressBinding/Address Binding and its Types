Address Binding :
The Association of program instruction and data to the actual physical memory locations is called the Address Binding.
Let’s consider the following example given below for better understanding.

Consider a program P1 has the set of instruction such that I1, I2, I3, I4, and program counter value is 10, 20, 30, 40 respectively.

Program P1
I1 --> 10
I2 --> 20
I3 --> 30
I4 --> 40

Program Counter = 10, 20, 30, 40

 Types of Address Binding :

   Address Binding divided into three types as follows.

     1. Compile-time Address Binding
     2. Load time Address Binding
     3. Execution time Address Binding

   Compile-time Address Binding :

     . If the compiler is responsible for performing address binding then it is called compile-time address binding.
     . It will be done before loading the program into memory.
     . The compiler requires interacts with an OS memory manager to perform compile-time address binding.

   Load time Address Binding :

     . It will be done after loading the program into memory.
     . This type of address binding will be done by the OS memory manager i.e loader.

   Execution time or dynamic Address Binding :

     . It will be postponed even after loading the program into memory.
     . The program will be kept on changing the locations in memory until the time of program execution.
     . The dynamic type of address binding done by the processor at the time of program execution.

 Note :
 The majority of the Operating System practically implement dynamic loading, dynamic linking, dynamic address binding.
  For example – Windows, Linux, Unix all popular OS.
