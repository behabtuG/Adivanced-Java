StringJoiner is a class in java.util package is used to construct a sequence of characters(strings) separated by a delimiter and
 optionally starting with a supplied prefix and ending with a given suffix. Though this can also be done with the help of the
 StringBuilder class to append delimiter after each string, StringJoiner provides an easy way to do that without much code to write.

 Constructors of StringJoiner Class

  1. StringJoiner(CharSequence delimiter): It constructs a StringJoiner with no characters, no prefix or suffix, and a copy of the
      supplied delimiter.

     Syntax:

       public StringJoiner(CharSequence delimiter)

    Parameters: The sequence of characters to be used between each element added to the StringJoiner value
    Exception Thrown: NullPointerException if the delimiter is null

  2. StringJoiner(CharSequence delimiter, CharSequence prefix, CharSequence suffix): It constructs a StringJoiner with no characters
      using copies of the supplied prefix, delimiter, and suffix. If no characters are added to the StringJoiner and methods
      accessing the string value are invoked, it will return the prefix + suffix (or properties thereof) in the result unless
      setEmptyValue has first been called.

     Syntax:

       public StringJoiner(CharSequence delimiter, CharSequence prefix, CharSequence suffix)

    Parameters:

     . The sequence of characters to be used between each element added to the StringJoiner value
     . The sequence of characters to be used at the beginning
     . The sequence of characters to be used at the end

    Exception Thrown: NullPointerException if prefix, delimiter, or suffix is null.
