CharBuffer holds a sequence of integer values to be used in an I/O operation. The CharBuffer class provides the following four
categories of operations upon long buffers:

   . Absolute and relative get method that read single Chars.
   . Absolute and relative put methods that write single Chars.
   . Relative bulk put and get methods that transfer contiguous sequences of Chars from an int array or some other Chars buffer into
     this buffer and from this buffer into an array.

 Short buffers can be created by:

   . allocate(): This allocates space for the bufferâ€™s content.
   . wrap(): This wraps an existing long array into a buffer.

  Most of the methods of CharBuffer class are directly analogous to the methods defined by ByteBuffer.

  Class Declaration:

        public abstract class CharBuffer
