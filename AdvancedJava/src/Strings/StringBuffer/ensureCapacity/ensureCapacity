The ensureCapacity() method of StringBuffer class ensures the capacity to at least equal to the specified minimumCapacity.

   . If the current capacity of StringBuffer < the argument minimumCapacity, then a new internal array is allocated with greater
     capacity.
   . If the minimumCapacity argument > twice the old capacity, plus 2 then new capacity is equal to minimumCapacity else new capacity
     is equal to twice the old capacity, plus 2.
   . If the minimumCapacity argument passed as parameter < 0, this method takes no action.

   Syntax:

     public void ensureCapacity(int minimumCapacity)

   Parameters: This method takes one parameter minimumCapacity which is the minimum desired capacity.
      Return Value: This method do not return anything.
