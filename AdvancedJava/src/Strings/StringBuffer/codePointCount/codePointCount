The codePointCount() method of StringBuffer class is used to return the number of Unicode code points in the specified range of
beginIndex to endIndex of String contained by StringBuffer. This method takes beginIndex and endIndex as a parameter where
beginIndex is the index of the first character of the text range and endIndex is index after the last character of the text range.
The indexes refer to char values (Unicode code units) and the value of index must be lie between 0 to length-1. The range starts
at the beginIndex and end at the char at index endIndex â€“ 1. Thus the length (in chars) of the text range is endIndex-beginIndex.

Syntax:

public int codePointCount(int beginIndex,
                               int endIndex)

Parameters: This method takes two parameters:

    beginIndex: int value representing index of the first character of the text range.
    endIndex: int value representing index after the last character of the text range.

Return Value: This method returns int value representing the number of Unicode code points in the specified text range.

Exception: This method throws IndexOutOfBoundsException if:

    the beginIndex is less than zero,
    or endIndex is larger than the length of String,
    or beginIndex is larger than endIndex.
