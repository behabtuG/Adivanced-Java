The subSequence(int start, int end) method of StringBuffer class is the inbuilt method used to return a subsequence of characters
lie between index start and end-1 of this sequence. The subsequence starts with the char value at the index start and ends with the
 char value at (end-1). The length of the returned subsequence is end-start. So if start is equal to end then an empty subsequence
 is returned.

  Syntax:

    public CharSequence subSequence?(int start, int end)

   Parameters:
    This method accepts two parameters:

    1. start which is Integer type value refers to the start index of subsequence.
    2. end which is Integer type value refers to the last index of subsequence.

  Returns:
  This method returns the specified subsequence in range start to end-1.
  Exception:
  if start or end are negative, if end is greater than length(), or if start is greater than end then IndexOutOfBoundsException is
  thrown.
