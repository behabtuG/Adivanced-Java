  In StringBuffer class, there are two types of indexOf() method depending upon the parameters passed to it.

 indexOf(String str)

   The indexOf(String str) method of StringBuffer class is used to return the index of the String for first occurrence of passed
   substring as parameter from the sequence contained by this object. If substring str is not present then -1 is returned in place
   of index.

  Syntax:

    public int indexOf(String str)

  Parameters: This method accepts str which is substring type value refers to the String whose index we want to get.
  Return Value: This method returns the index of the first occurrence of the passed substring, or -1 if there is no such substring
   present.

   Below programs illustrate the StringBuffer.indexOf() method:

   Example 1: when passed substring is present in the sequence.

 indexOf(String str, int fromIndex):

   The indexOf(String str, int fromIndex) method of StringBuffer class is used to return the index within the String for first
   occurrence of passed substring starting from the specified index ‘fromIndex’. If substring str is not present then -1 is returned.
    fromIndex is Integer type value refers to the index of the start of the search. If string present before the index of the start
    of search but not after then -1 will return.

     Syntax:

       public int indexOf(String str, int fromIndex)

     Parameters: This method accepts two one parameters str which is String type value refers to the String whose index we want to
      get and fromIndex which is Integer type value refers to the index from which to start the search.

     Returns: This method returns the index of the first occurrence of the passed substring starting at the specified index, or -1
      if there is no such substring present.

     Below programs illustrate the StringBuffer.indexOf() method:

     Example 1: when passed substring is present in the sequence.
