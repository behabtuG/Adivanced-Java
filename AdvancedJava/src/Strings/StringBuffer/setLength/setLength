The setLength(int newLength) method of StringBuffer class is the inbuilt method used to set the length of the character sequence
equal to newLength. If the newLength passed as argument is less than the old length, the old length is changed to the newLength.
If the newLength passed as argument is greater than or equal to the old length, null characters (‘\u0000’) are appended at the end
of old sequence so that length becomes the newLength argument.
