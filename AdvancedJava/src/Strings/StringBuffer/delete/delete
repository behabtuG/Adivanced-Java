The java.lang.StringBuffer.delete() is an inbuilt method in Java which is used to remove or delete the characters in a substring
of this sequence. The substring starts at a specified index start_point and extends to the character at the index end_point.

Syntax :

public StringBuffer delete(int start_point, int end_point)

Parameters : The method accepts two parameters of integer type:
start_point – This refers to the beginning index and is included in the count.
end_point – This refer to the ending index and is excluded from the count.

Return Value : The method returns the string after deleting the substring formed by the range mentioned in the parameters.

Exceptions : StringIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs if the start_point is negative, greater than length(), or greater than the
end_point.

Examples :

Input: String = "Apple"
            start_point = 2
            end_point = 4

Output: Ape

Input: String = "GeeksforGeeks"
       start_point = 2
       end_point = 7

Output: GerGeeks
