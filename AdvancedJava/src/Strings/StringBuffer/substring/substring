In StringBuffer class, there are two types of substring method depending upon the parameters passed to it.

  substring(int start)

    The substring(int start) method of StringBuffer class is the inbuilt method used to return a substring start from index start
    and extends to end of this sequence. The string returned by this method contains all character from index start to end of
    the old sequence.

     Syntax:

       public String substring(int start)

      Parameters: This method accepts only one parameter start which is Integer type value refers to the start index of substring.

     Return Value: This method returns the substring lie in the range start to end of old sequence.

     Exception: This method throws StringIndexOutOfBoundsException if start is less than zero, or greater than the length of this
      object.

     Below programs illustrate the StringBuffer substring() method:

  substring(int start, int end)

     The substring(int start, int end) method of StringBuffer class is the inbuilt method used to return a substring start from
     index start and extends to the index end-1 of this sequence. The string returned by this method contains all character from
     index start to index end-1 of the old sequence.

     Syntax:

       public String substring(int start)

     Parameters: This method accepts two parameter start which is Integer type value refers to the start index of substring and end
      which is also a Integer type value refers to the end index of substring.

     Return Value: This method returns the substring lie in the range index start to index end-1 of old sequence.

     Exception: This method throws StringIndexOutOfBoundsException if start or end are negative or greater than length(), or start is
      greater than end.
