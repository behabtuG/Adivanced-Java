The toString() method of StringBuffer class is the inbuilt method used to returns a string representing the data contained by
 StringBuffer Object. A new String object is created and initialized to get the character sequence from this StringBuffer object
 and then String is returned by toString(). Subsequent changes to this sequence contained by Object do not affect the contents of
 the String.

  Syntax:

     public abstract String toString()

 Return Value: This method returns the String representing the data contained by StringBuffer Object.

 Below programs illustrate the StringBuffer.toString() method:
