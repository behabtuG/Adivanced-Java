The offsetByCodePoints() method of StringBuffer class returns the index within this String contained by StringBuffer that is
 offset from the index passed as parameter by codePointOffset code points. Unpaired surrogates lies between index and
 codePointOffset count as one code point each.

Syntax:

public int offsetByCodePoints(int index,
                       int codePointOffset)

Parameters: This method takes two parameters:

    . index: the index to be offset
    . codePointOffset: the offset in code points

Return Value: This method returns the index within this sequence.

 Exception: This method throws IndexOutOfBoundsException if any one below is true:

     . index < 0 or index > length of the sequence.
     . codePointOffset > 0 and the subsequence starting with index has fewer than codePointOffset code points
     . codePointOffset < and the subsequence before index has fewer than the absolute value of codePointOffset code points.
