The trimToSize() method of StringBuffer class is the inbuilt method used to trims the capacity used for the character sequence of
StringBuffer object. If the buffer used by StringBuffer object is larger than necessary to hold its current sequence of characters,
then this method is called to resize the StringBuffer object for converting this object to more space efficient. Calling this method
may, but is not required to, affect the value returned by a subsequent call to the capacity() method.

   Syntax:

     public void trimToSize()

  Returns: This method does not return anything.

  Below programs illustrate the StringBuffer.trimToSize() method:
