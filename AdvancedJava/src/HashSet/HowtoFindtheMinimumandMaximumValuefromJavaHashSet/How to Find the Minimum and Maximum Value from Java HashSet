HashSet is used to store distinct values in Java. The HashSet does not guarantee the constant order of elements over time, which means when we iterate a HashSet, there is no guarantee that we get the same order of elements as we added in order. HashSet does not provide any built-in method to get the maximum and minimum values.

There are a couple of ways to find the maximum and minimum from the HashSet in Java:

    Using Collection class
    Using simple iteration

Method 1: Using Collections class

     Using Collections class in Java we can find maximum and minimum value with the help of max() and min() method of Collections class.

Method 2: Using Simple Iteration

    We can find Maximum and Minimum using simply iterate the HashSet and maintain the min and max variable and update it accordingly
      while traversing through each element and comparing it with the min and max values.
