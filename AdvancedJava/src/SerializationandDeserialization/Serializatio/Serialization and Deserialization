Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream. Deserialization is the reverse process where
the byte stream is used to recreate the actual Java object in memory. This mechanism is used to persist the object.
The byte stream created is platform independent. So, the object serialized on one platform can be deserialized on a different platform.
To make a Java object serializable we implement the java.io.Serializable interface.
The ObjectOutputStream class contains writeObject() method for serializing an Object.

public final void writeObject(Object obj)
                       throws IOException

The ObjectInputStream class contains readObject() method for deserializing an object.

public final Object readObject()
                  throws IOException,
               ClassNotFoundException

  Advantages of Serialization
     1. To save/persist state of an object.
     2. To travel an object across a network.

  Only the objects of those classes can be serialized which are implementing java.io.Serializable interface.
  Serializable is a marker interface (has no data member and method). It is used to “mark” java classes so that objects of these
   classes may get certain capability. Other examples of marker interfaces are:- Cloneable and Remote.

  Points to remember
  1. If a parent class has implemented Serializable interface then child class doesn’t need to implement it but vice-versa is not true.
  2. Only non-static data members are saved via Serialization process.
  3. Static data members and transient data members are not saved via Serialization process.So, if you don’t want to save value of a non-static data member then make it transient.
  4. Constructors.Constructor of object is never called when an object is deserialized.
  5. Associated objects must be implementing Serializable interface.

 Example :

  class A implements Serializable{

   // B also implements Serializable
   // interface.
   B ob=new B();
   }

SerialVersionUID
  The Serialization runtime associates a version number with each Serializable class called a SerialVersionUID, which is used during Deserialization to verify that sender and
  receiver of a serialized object have loaded classes for that object which are compatible with respect to serialization. If the receiver has loaded a class for the object that
  has different UID than that of corresponding sender’s class, the Deserialization will result in an InvalidClassException. A Serializable class can declare its own UID explicitly by declaring a field name.
  It must be static, final and of type long.
  i.e- ANY-ACCESS-MODIFIER static final long serialVersionUID=42L;

  If a serializable class doesn’t explicitly declare a serialVersionUID, then the serialization runtime will calculate a default one for that class based on various aspects of class,
  as described in Java Object Serialization Specification. However it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialVersionUID value, since its computation
  is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations, any change in class or using different id may affect the serialized data.

  It is also recommended to use private modifier for UID since it is not useful as inherited member.

  serialver
  The serialver is a tool that comes with JDK. It is used to get serialVersionUID number for Java classes.
  You can run the following command to get serialVersionUID

  serialver [-classpath classpath] [-show] [classname…]

  Description for Output:
  You have seen while deserializing the object the values of a and b has changed. The reason being a was marked as transient and b was static.
  In case of transient variables:- A variable defined with transient keyword is not serialized during serialization process.
  This variable will be initialized with default value during deserialization. (e.g: for objects it is null, for int it is 0).
  In case of static Variables:- A variable defined with static keyword is not serialized during serialization process.
  This variable will be loaded with current value defined in the class during deserialization.
