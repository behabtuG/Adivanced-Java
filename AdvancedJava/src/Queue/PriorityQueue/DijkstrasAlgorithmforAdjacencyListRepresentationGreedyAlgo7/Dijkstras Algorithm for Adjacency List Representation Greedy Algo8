Given a graph and a source vertex in the graph, find the shortest paths from the source to all vertices in the given graph.

Examples:

    Input: src = 0, the graph is shown below.

    Output: 0 4 12 19 21 11 9 8 14
    Explanation: The distance from 0 to 1 = 4.
    The minimum distance from 0 to 2 = 12. 0->1->2
    The minimum distance from 0 to 3 = 19. 0->1->2->3
    The minimum distance from 0 to 4 = 21. 0->7->6->5->4
    The minimum distance from 0 to 5 = 11. 0->7->6->5
    The minimum distance from 0 to 6 = 9. 0->7->6
    The minimum distance from 0 to 7 = 8. 0->7
    The minimum distance from 0 to 8 = 14. 0->1->2->8

  Dijkstra shortest path algorithm using Prim’s Algorithm in O(V2):
        Dijkstra’s algorithm is very similar to Prim’s algorithm for minimum spanning tree.

        Like Prim’s MST, generate a SPT (shortest path tree) with a given source as a root. Maintain two sets, one set contains vertices included in the shortest-path tree,
        other set includes vertices not yet included in the shortest-path tree. At every step of the algorithm, find a vertex that is in the other set (set not yet included)
        and has a minimum distance from the source.

  Follow the steps below to solve the problem:

      Create a set sptSet (shortest path tree set) that keeps track of vertices included in the shortest-path tree, i.e., whose minimum distance from the source is calculated and finalized. Initially, this set is empty.
      Assign a distance value to all vertices in the input graph. Initialize all distance values as INFINITE. Assign the distance value as 0 for the source vertex so that it is picked first.
      While sptSet doesn’t include all vertices
          Pick a vertex u which is not there in sptSet and has a minimum distance value.
          Include u to sptSet.
          Then update distance value of all adjacent vertices of u.
              To update the distance values, iterate through all adjacent vertices.
              For every adjacent vertex v, if the sum of the distance value of u (from source) and weight of edge u-v, is less than the distance value of v, then update the distance value of v.

      Note: We use a boolean array sptSet[] to represent the set of vertices included in SPT. If a value sptSet[v] is true, then vertex v is included in SPT, otherwise not.
      Array dist[] is used to store the shortest distance values of all vertices.

      Below is the illustration of the above approach:

      Illustration:

      To understand the Dijkstra’s Algorithm lets take a graph and find the shortest path from source to all nodes.
      Consider below graph and src = 0

      Step 1:

        . The set sptSet is initially empty and distances assigned to vertices are {0, INF, INF, INF, INF, INF, INF, INF} where INF indicates infinite.
        . Now pick the vertex with a minimum distance value. The vertex 0 is picked, include it in sptSet. So sptSet becomes {0}. After including 0 to sptSet, update distance values of its adjacent vertices.
        . Adjacent vertices of 0 are 1 and 7. The distance values of 1 and 7 are updated as 4 and 8.

        The following subgraph shows vertices and their distance values, only the vertices with finite distance values are shown. The vertices included in SPT are shown in green colour.

      Step 2:

          . Pick the vertex with minimum distance value and not already included in SPT (not in sptSET). The vertex 1 is picked and added to sptSet.
          . So sptSet now becomes {0, 1}. Update the distance values of adjacent vertices of 1.
          . The distance value of vertex 2 becomes 12.

      Step 3:

          . Pick the vertex with minimum distance value and not already included in SPT (not in sptSET). Vertex 7 is picked. So sptSet now becomes {0, 1, 7}.
          . Update the distance values of adjacent vertices of 7. The distance value of vertex 6 and 8 becomes finite (15 and 9 respectively).

      Step 4:

          . Pick the vertex with minimum distance value and not already included in SPT (not in sptSET). Vertex 6 is picked. So sptSet now becomes {0, 1, 7, 6}.
          . Update the distance values of adjacent vertices of 6. The distance value of vertex 5 and 8 are updated.

      We repeat the above steps until sptSet includes all vertices of the given graph. Finally, we get the following Shortest Path Tree (SPT).

  Time Complexity: O(V2)
  Auxiliary Space: O(V)

  Notes:

      . The code calculates the shortest distance but doesn’t calculate the path information. Create a parent array, update the parent array when distance is updated (like prim’s implementation),
        and use it to show the shortest path from source to different vertices.
      . The code is for undirected graphs, the same Dijkstra function can be used for directed graphs also.
      . The code finds the shortest distances from the source to all vertices. If we are interested only in the shortest distance from the source to a single target, break them for a loop when the
        picked minimum distance vertex is equal to the target.
      . The time Complexity of the implementation is O(V2). If the input graph is represented using adjacency list, it can be reduced to O(E * log V) with the help of a binary heap. Please see Dijkstra’s
        Algorithm for Adjacency List Representation for more details.
      . Dijkstra’s algorithm doesn’t work for graphs with negative weight cycles. It may give correct results for a graph with negative edges but you must allow a vertex can be visited multiple times and that
        version will lose its fast time complexity. For graphs with negative weight edges and cycles, the Bellman-Ford algorithm can be used, we will soon be discussing it as a separate post.

  Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm using Heap in O(E logV):

  For Dijkstra’s algorithm, it is always recommended to use Heap (or priority queue) as the required operations (extract minimum and decrease key) match with the specialty of the heap (or priority queue). However, the problem is, that priority_queue doesn’t support the decrease key. To resolve this problem, do not update a key, but insert one more copy of it. So we allow multiple instances of the same vertex in the priority queue. This approach doesn’t require decreasing key operations and has below important properties.

      .Whenever the distance of a vertex is reduced, we add one more instance of a vertex in priority_queue. Even if there are multiple instances, we only consider the instance with minimum distance and ignore other instances.
      .The time complexity remains O(E * LogV) as there will be at most O(E) vertices in the priority queue and O(logE) is the same as O(logV)

  Below is the implementation of the above approach:

  Time Complexity: O(E * logV), Where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices.
  Auxiliary Space: O(V)
