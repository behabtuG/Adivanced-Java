Like C++, Java automatically creates default constructor if there is no default or parameterized constructor written by user, and (like C++)
the default constructor automatically calls parent default constructor. But unlike C++, default constructor in Java initializes member data
variable to default values (numeric values are initialized as 0, booleans are initialized as false and references are initialized as null).

For example, output of the below program is

  0
  null
  false
  0
  0.0
