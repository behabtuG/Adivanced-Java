Given a string of characters. The task is to write a program to print the characters of this string in sorted order using stack.

Examples:

Input: str = "geeksforgeeks"
Output: eeeefggkkorss

Input: str = "hello395world216"
Output: 123569dehllloorw

Approach:

    . Initialize two stacks, one stack, and other tempstack.
    . Insert the first character of the string in the stack.
    . Iterate for all the characters in the string
        1. if the ith character is greater than or equal to the top element of the stack, then push the element.
        2. if the ith character is not greater, then push all the elements of the stack into tempstack, and then push the character into the stack.
         After this, push all the greater elements of tempstack to stack.

   Print the all elements of the stack in reverse order when the iteration is completed.

Complexity Analysis:

    Time Complexity: O(n2)
    Auxiliary Space: O(n)
